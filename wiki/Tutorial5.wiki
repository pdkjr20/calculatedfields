= Details =
  * remember to encapsulate fields with {}, name of field is case insensitive.
*{{{ {AvGPACe} }}}*
  * basic math<br>
*{{{ {DISTANCE} * 5 / 20 * 1.2343 - (500 + 20.3443) * 0.32443 }}}*
  * strings concatenations and combining strings with fields
*{{{ "this is our test string, distance is: " + {DISTANCE} + " and pace is: " + {AVGPACE} }}}*
  * check if text contains some string, for example check if Category contains text Running
*{{{ {CATEGORY}.Contains("Running") }}}*
  * you can use regular expressions !
*{{{ Regex.Match({WEATHERNOTES}, "[0-9]*.[0-9]*").Value }}}*
  * You can combine as many fields as you want in one formula
*{{{ {DISTANCE} / {AVGPACE} + 120 + {AVGHR} }}}*
